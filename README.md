# Slot bot

### Quick Start

Install Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/

- Be sure that the slot is avaliable through your network, otherwise use proxy, I use https://windscribe.com/

- Run `install.bat` or open command line in it's folder and type:

```$ npm install```

- After it finishes installing, run `run.bat` or open command line in it's folder and type: 

```$ npm start```

It'll open browser. Get to the page with slot on it. And it'll play according to it's settings.

Settings can be managed inside of settings.json

When the process is finished, details can be found at `details.json`."# casino_slots"
